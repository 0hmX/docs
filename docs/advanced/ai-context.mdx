You can drop our AI context into your Claude or OpenAI project by downloading
the [`ai.txt`](https://docs.tscircuit.com/ai.txt) file and dropping it into your project.

This will teach Claude and OpenAI about tscircuit so it can help you design
boards or access tricky or hidden pieces of the documentation!

You can also use our [Official GPT on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67b2911b5af08191bdde2d4a0c8c1076-tscircuit-helper) or [chat.tscircuit.com](https://chat.tscircuit.com)
for prebuilt versions of the AI. Note: [chat.tscircuit.com](https://chat.tscircuit.com)
contains live preview for a great development experience.
