title: Bounties and Sponsorship
---

tscircuit has thousands dollars (USD) of bounties opened every month in over
50 new weekly issues. We also automatically sponsor regular contributors
hundreds of dollars each based on their contributions, which we track with Github's API
in our weekly [contribution-tracker](https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker)
(resets every Wednesday)

Many people follow the [bounties channel on discord](https://discord.com/channels/1233487248129921135/1301957862762872832) or our [bounty board](https://console.algora.io/org/tscircuit/bounties?status=open)
to find issues to contribute to, but **this is actually the hardest way to get bounties!**

The easiest way to get bounties and sponsorship is to _actually use tscircuit and try to build a circuit_. When you
find something confusing or buggy, create an issue. When you create an issue that
gets bountied, you get extra points on the contribution tracker and you become
the best person to fix the issue because you understand it so well! If you
continually do this, you'll find that their are infinite issues to be done!

To be eligible for Github Sponsorship, you must be in a supported country and
have Github Sponsors enabled on your Github profile.
