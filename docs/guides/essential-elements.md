There are some essential elements you'll need for almost every circuit you make,
this doc gives a brief overview of each of them so you can jump right in and
get started building electronics!

| Element                                      | Description                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`<board />`](../elements/board.mdx)         | The root element of a circuit, defines the size of the board and the autorouter |
| [`<chip />`](../elements/chip.mdx)           | The chip element is used to represent a packaged integrated circuit (IC).       |
| [`<trace />`](../elements/trace.mdx)         | The trace element is used to connect two points on the board.                   |
| [`<led />`](../elements/led.mdx)             | The led element is used to represent an LED.                                    |
| [`<resistor />`](../elements/resistor.mdx)   | The resistor element is used to represent a resistor.                           |
| [`<capacitor />`](../elements/capacitor.mdx) | The capacitor element is used to represent a capacitor.                         |
| [`<diode />`](../elements/diode.mdx)         | The diode element is used to represent a diode.                                 |
