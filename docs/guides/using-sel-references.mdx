title: Using "sel" References
---

The `sel` object is a special import that allows you to easily reference
components with a bit more type-safety than a string. It can also be more ergonomic
than typing out a [port selector](./port-and-net-selectors.md).

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview defaultView="code" code={`
import { sel } from "tscircuit"

export default () => (
  <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
    <resistor
      resistance="1k"
      footprint="0402"
      name="R1"
    />
    <capacitor
      capacitance="1000pF"
      footprint="0402"
      name="C1"
    />
    <trace from={sel.R1.pin1} to={sel.C1.pos} />
  </board>
)
`} />


The `sel` can be thought of as a very large mapping of conventional strings.

Here are some `sel` expressions and their corresponding string:

```tsx
import { sel } from "tscircuit"

sel.R1.pin1
// ".R1 > .pin1"

sel.C1.pos
// ".C1 > .pos"

sel.net.GND
// "net.GND"

sel.U1.GPIO1
// ".U1 > .GPIO1"
```

So `sel` is really just a slightly more type-safe, conventional way of writing
[port selectors](./port-and-net-selectors.md). Where possible, it's much better to use [component hooks](../elements/chip.mdx#type-safe-chips-custom-component-hooks)
because they can guarantee more type-safety and have the exact pins that a chip
supports.
