title: Manual Edits
---

It can be cumbersome to programmatically define the locations of every component
on the PCB and schematic, but [automatic layout](./automatic-layout.mdx) can
be too uncontrolled. Manual edits allow you to use a schematic or PCB viewer
to drag and drop components.

Every time you drag a component, a file conventionally called `manual-edits.json`
is edited with your edits. This manual edits file is imported and can be given
as the `manualEdits` prop to a `<board />` or `<subcircuit />`

## Creating Manual Edits with a GUI

Each GUI features an "edit button" to turn on an editing mode. After you turn
on the editing mode, you can drag and drop components and your edits will
automatically edit the `manual-edits.json` file.

### Creating Manual Edits in the Schematic Viewer

In the top-right corner there is a pencil edit button. This turns on the edit
mode.

### Creating Manual Edits in the PCB Viewer

The PCB Viewer features two edits modes:

- Edit Trace Mode
- Move Components Mode

You can find both of them by hovering over the PCB viewer.

### Troubleshooting manual edits not being applied

Usually if manual edits aren't being applied, it's because you haven't imported
the `manual-edits.json` file. On the [tscircuit.com editor](https://tscircuit.com),
you'll get a warning that automatically edits your code to insert the import.

If you're editing locally, add the following lines:

```tsx
import manualEdits from "./manual-edits.json"

export default () => (
  //                                VVVV add this prop!
  <board width="10mm" height="10mm" manualEdits={manualEdits}>
    {/* ... */}
  </board>
)
```

If you're still not seeing your manual edits, select the `manual-edits.json`
file from the tscircuit editor or find the file on your filesystem. Make sure
that it changes when you drag'n'drop components.
