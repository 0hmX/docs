## Overview

After [you've designed your device](./designing-electronics-from-scratch.md),
you can use [fabrication files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)
to get your device fully assembled.

The two most popular services for
ordering prototypes are [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com).

## Uploading [Fabrication Files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)

Most fabrication or turn-key assembly services allow you to directly upload 3 types of files:

- Gerbers
- Bill of Materials (BOM CSV)
- Pick'n'Place File (CSV)

These files are all available inside your [Fabrication Files zip file](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md) when
you export from tscircuit.

## Assembling your own boards

It can sometimes be easier to assemble your own boards, this gives you more
control over your inventory and can lower the cost of your prototypes since
assembly services often have a minimum order quantity.

Even if you're assembling your own board, you should still order your PCB
from a fabrication service. PCBs require a chemical etching process to do
at home and it's rarely worth the hassle to do it yourself.

When you're assembling your own board, you can create a printout of your
Assembly View to make it easier to place components. In an assembly view,
the "pin1" location is marked with a cut corner. This can help you verify
the orientation of each component as you place it.
