## Overview

A `<resistor />` is an extremely common element of electronic designs. It limits
the flow of electricity and is critial to making sure digital signals are
properly "pulled up" or "pulled down" to set their default value as `1` or `0`

A resistor element has two pins and is non-polar, meaning it doesn't matter if
you place it on backwards (it resists electricity identically either way!)

When specifying a resistor, you'll usually want to give it a footprint string
such as `0402` or `0603` to indicate it's size. Different 


## Tolerances

Resistors can be made to different tolerances. In particular, you might care
about the following resistor characteristics:

- **tolerance** - a percentage given with a string, e.g. `tolerance="5%"`. This specifies how accurate the resistance needs to be
- **temperatureOperatingRange** - a string indicating the listed range for the resistor's operating temperature `"-15F-150F"`

## Automatic Part Selection

You generally don't need to specify `supplierPartNumbers` with a resistor, tscircuit
will use the [platform parts engine](../guides/platform-configuration.md) to
automatically search vendors for a part matching your tolerances.
