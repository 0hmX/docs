## Overview

A `<subcircuit />` is a powerful organizational element in tscircuit that
represents a collection of elements that are tightly coupled. Subcircuits are
often used for a small functional block, such as a voltage regulator.

Within a subcircuit, you can have a custom autorouter or isolated nets from the
larger circuits. You can also re-use reference designators. Your subcircuit is
essentially isolated from other subcircuits.

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit1" schX={-2}>
        <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" />
      </subcircuit>
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit2" schX={2}>
        <resistor name="R2" resistance="1k"  />
      </subcircuit>
      <trace from=".subcircuit1 .R1 .pin1" to=".subcircuit2 .R2 .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

## Reuse Reference Designators

Reusing reference designators is typically considered a bad practice, but in
tscircuit reference designators are intelligently prefixed prior to being
written on the silkscreen. This means that you can design your subcircuits
without worrying about whether or not a reference designator has been previously
used.

Within a subcircuit, you'll never select inside of another subcircuit without
explicitly specifying the subcircuit `name` in a selector. This means you never
need to worry about other `R1` or `C1` selectors from other subcircuits, they
will not be selected unless you explicitly include a subcircuit selector
e.g. `.somesubcircuit .R1`

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit1" schX={-2}>
        <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" />
      </subcircuit>
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit2" schX={2}>
        <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" />
      </subcircuit>
      <trace from=".subcircuit1 .R1 .pin1" to=".subcircuit2 .R1 .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

## Configuring the Autorouter

Subcircuits can have a custom autorouter configuration. This will be inherited
by any children subcircuits.

To specify a custom autorouter configuration, just set the `autorouter` property
on a `<subcircuit />` element.

```tsx
<subcircuit autorouter="auto-cloud">
  <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" />
  <resistor name="R2" resistance="1k" footprint="0402" />
  {/* ... */}
</subcircuit>
```

Specifying custom autorouter settings for subcircuits can be extremely useful
when you have a tricky section of components that have special requirements.
