title: <board />
---

The `<board />` element is a root element that contains all the chips and traces
to create a PCB.

You can think of a `<board />` like a `<body />` element in HTML. Everything
goes in a board!


import CircuitPreview from '@site/src/components/CircuitPreview'

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => (
  <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
    <resistor resistance="1k" footprint="0402" name="R1" />
  </board>
)

`} />


## Customizing the Size of the Board

Generally you'll use the `width` and `height` properties to define the size of
the board.


### Custom Board Outlines

You can specify a custom outline for your board by passing an `outline` prop.
The PCB you get will have this outline cut out, this is great when you want a
board that's not a rectangle!

<CircuitPreview defaultView="pcb" code={`

export default () => (
  <board
    outline={[
      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 24.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: 20.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: 20.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: 22.5, y: 2.5 },
      { x: 18, y: -1.5 },
      { x: 18, y: -18 },
      { x: -18, y: -18 },
      { x: -18, y: -1.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 2.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: -20.5, y: 12.5 },
      { x: -20.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 16.5 },
      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },
    ]}

    // These are currently required due to this issue:

    width="50mm"
    height="50mm"
  />
)

`} />
