The `<chip />` is the most common and most powerful built-in tscircuit element.
You can represent virtually any "single-part" electronic component with `<chip />`,
it is extremely flexible.

## Simple Chips

Here's an example of typical `<chip />` usage. We specify a footprint string and
the pin labels that should be used for the schematic representation.

```tsx simple-chip.tsx
import type { CommonLayoutProps } from "tscircuit"

interface Props extends CommonLayoutProps {
  name: string
}

export const A555Timer = (props: Props) => {
  return (
    <chip
      footprint="soic8"
      pinLabels={{
        pin1: "VCC",
        pin2: "DISCH",
        pin3: "THRES",
        pin4: "CTRL",
        pin5: "GND",
        pin6: "TRIG",
        pin7: "OUT",
        pin8: "RESET"
      }}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```
