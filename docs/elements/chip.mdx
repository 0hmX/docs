The `<chip />` is the most common and most powerful built-in tscircuit element.
You can represent virtually any "single-part" electronic component with `<chip />`,
it is extremely flexible.

## Simple Chips

Here's an example of typical `<chip />` usage. We specify a footprint string and
the pin labels that should be used for the schematic representation.

```tsx simple-chip.tsx
import type { CommonLayoutProps } from "tscircuit"

interface Props extends CommonLayoutProps {
  name: string
}

export const A555Timer = (props: Props) => {
  return (
    <chip
      footprint="soic8"
      pinLabels={{
        pin1: "VCC",
        pin2: "DISCH",
        pin3: "THRES",
        pin4: "CTRL",
        pin5: "GND",
        pin6: "TRIG",
        pin7: "OUT",
        pin8: "RESET"
      }}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

## Custom Footprints

Often you will have a chip that you want to carefully specify the position of
each pad, plated hole, silkscreen line or other PCB element. To do this, just
insert a `<footprint />` component instead of string for the `footprint` prop.

```tsx

```

For more information about custom footprints, check out the [<footprint /> element](./footprint.mdx)

## Creating Custom Component Hooks

Component hooks are a great way to 

```tsx
import { createUseComponent, type CommonLayoutProps } from "tscircuit"

interface Props extends CommonLayoutProps {
  name: string
}


const pinLabels = {
  pin1: "VCC",
  pin2: "DISCH",
  pin3: "THRES",
  pin4: "CTRL",
  pin5: "GND",
  pin6: "TRIG",
  pin7: "OUT",
  pin8: "RESET"
} as const

export const A555Timer = (props: Props) => (
  <chip
    footprint="soic8"
    pinLabels={pinLabels}
    {...props}
  />
)

export const use555Timer = createUseComponent(A555Timer, pinLabels)
```

:::warning
Make sure to have `as const` when you're defining your `pinLabels`, if you're
missing this the types won't work!
:::

When you use Component Hooks, you get better type checking in your component usage
because all the pin labels are now available on the component!

```tsx
import { use555Timer } from "./a555timer"
import { usePowerRegulator } from "./power-regulator"

export default () => {
  const U1 = use555Timer("U1")
  const M1 = usePowerRegulator("M1")

  return (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <U1 />
      <M1 />

      <trace from={U1.GND} to="net.GND" />
      <trace from={U1.VCC} to={M1.V5} />
    </board>
  )
}
```


## Getting Chips from JLCPCB, KiCad or Circuit JSON

There are a lot of ways to import a chip configuration, each with their own
guide! This is often much easier and reliable than configuring a chip yourself.
