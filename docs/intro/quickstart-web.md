You can use tscircuit online without installing anything on [tscircuit.com](https://tscircuit.com)!

## Using the Online Editor

The [tscircuit online editor](https://tscircuit.com/editor) is a full Typescript editor with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, type-checking and tools for importing snippets and configuring chips.

There are two types of projects you can create in the online editor.

- "board": this is a fully-functional electronic device that you can order
- "module": This is a reusable component, usually a specific chip or subcircuit, that you can use across many boards or to break up a complex board into smaller, more manageable pieces.
