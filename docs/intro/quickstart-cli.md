## Install the tscircuit CLI

You can install the tscircuit CLI by running `npm install -g tscircuit`.

## Create a new Project

First, create a new tscircuit project by running `tsci init`. This will create a new directory with all the necessary files to get started:

![tsci init result](../../static/img/tsci-init.png)

## Run the Development Server

Next, start the development server by running `tsci dev`. This will start a local server that automatically rebuilds your circuit when you make changes:

![tsci dev result](../../static/img/tsci-dev.png)

Go to https://localhost:3020. You'll can now see PCB, Schematic and 3D views of your circuit, which update in real-time as you make changes to your code.
